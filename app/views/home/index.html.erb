<p>Carnatic music is a system of music commonly associated with the southern part of the Indian subcontinent, 
with its area roughly confined to four modern states of India: Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu. 
It is one of two main sub-genres of Indian classical music that evolved from ancient Hindu traditions; 
the other sub-genre being Hindustani music, which emerged as a distinct form because of Persian and Islamic influences in North India. 
In contrast to Hindustani music, the main emphasis in Carnatic music is on vocal music; 
most compositions are written to be sung, and even when played on instruments, they are meant to be performed in gƒÅyaki (singing) style.</p>
